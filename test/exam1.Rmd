# Exam 1

## Statistics Using R

##### 1a) 9 jobs. 48% probability.

```{r}
n = 9
prob = 0.48

pbinom(3, 9, 0.48, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

* Answer: Probability of 3+ offers = .70519 or 70.519%

##### 1b) 95% confident of 3+ offers. How many jobs should she apply for?

```{r}
mean = 3
z = 1.96

pbinom(3, 14, 0.48, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

* Answer: She should apply for 14 jobs

##### 2) 
* Option A: < 8,500 guests
* Option B: < 9,400 guests
* Option C: < 11,800 guests

mean = 10,000
sd = 1,200
Which option has a 7% chancce of being too small?

```{r}

pnorm(8500, mean=10000, sd=1200, lower.tail=FALSE)

pnorm(9400, mean=10000, sd=1200, lower.tail = FALSE)

pnorm(11800, mean = 10000, sd = 1200, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

* Answer: Option C has approximately a 7% chance of being too small 


## Graphics Using R

#### 1) Twitteraccount

```{r}
twitter = read.csv(paste(dir, 'twitteraccount.csv', sep = '/'))
```

##### A Graph 1

Use geom_boxplot and color to differentiate between journalist and news

```{r}
ggplot(twitter, aes(x = category, y = followers, color = category)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Journalist and News Followers")
```

```{r}
ggplot(twitter, aes(x = category, y = following, color = category)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Journalist and News Following")
```


##### B Graph 2

```{r}
ggplot(twitter, aes(x = following, y = followers, color = category)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Followers",
                     limits = c(0, 600000),
                     breaks = c(100000, 200000, 300000, 400000, 500000, 600000),
                     labels = c('100K', '200K', '300K', '400K', '500K', '600K')) +
  theme_minimal()
```

##### C Graph 3


```{r}

ggplot(twitter, aes(x = following, y = followers, color = category)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Followers",
                     limits = c(0, 600000),
                     breaks = c(100000, 200000, 300000, 400000, 500000, 600000),
                     labels = c('100K', '200K', '300K', '400K', '500K', '600K')) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = 'Following') + 
  facet_wrap(~category) +
  theme_minimal()
```


### 2) Bus Breakdown and Delays

```{r}
breakdowns = read.csv(paste(dir, 'Bus_Breakdown_and_Delays.csv', sep = '/'))
data = data.frame(Reason = breakdowns$Reason, Boro = breakdowns$Boro, Notified = breakdowns$Has_Contractor_Notified_Parents)

mosaic(table(data), shade = TRUE, legend = TRUE)
```

##### A Couple of insights from the mosaic chart
* Blue tiles indicate a greater frequency, so Flat Tires have the highest frequency of the Reasons.
* Queens rarely has accidents compared to Brooklyn and Manhattan
* Queens has the highest frequency of Flat Tires
* Weather Conditions tend to affect Brooklyn the most
* Parents are less likely to be Notified of Accidents


#### 3) Hedging

```{r}

hedging = read.csv(paste(dir, 'hedging.csv', sep='/'))

data = data.frame(mean_income = hedging$family_income_mean, mean_rent = hedging$gross_rent_mean, mean_owner_cost = hedging$owner_cost_mean, mean_household_income = hedging$household_income_mean)
```


##### Graph A - Scatterplot Matrix


```{r}
pairs(data)
```

###### Interpretation
* Mean Income and Mean Household Income are very strongly correlated
* All the charts are positively correlated, so this means that as one variable increases, so does the other variable


##### Graph B - SmoothScatter

```{r}
smoothScatter(hedging$household_income_mean, hedging$gross_rent_mean)
```
